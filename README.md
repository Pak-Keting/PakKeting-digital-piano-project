# My Digital Piano Project
> *"I don't even know if this project would be realized."*

I've spend quite some time finding the resources for the Grand Feel (III generation to be specific) action back then, about the action mechanism, the dimension, and etc. Only to then be forgotten completely, and I ended up with all these file from my past self without any documentation whatsoever, which is unfortunate. Learning from my past mistake of not documenting it, I created this repo and try to consolidate and documented all my finding into this repo. For starter, I'll be uploading all the resources (the pictures of the action) for the mechanical part. This will be for my future self to take the measurement of the key dimension. Software probably next *(or never)*.

If you also looking for the resources, especially to reference the Grand Feel dimension, feel free to use the pictures inside ./researches folder. I've tried my best to obtain the highest resolution of all generation of Grand Feel action pictures, hopefully it'll be easier to take accurate measurement based on it.
